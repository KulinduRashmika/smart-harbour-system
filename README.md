# Smart Harbour System

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Smart Harbour System** is an IoT-based project designed to monitor and manage harbour-related data in real time. Sensors connected to an ESP microcontroller (ESP8266) collect environmental or operational data and send it to **Firebase Realtime Database**, enabling live updates, remote monitoring, and real-time synchronization between hardware and web/mobile interfaces.
